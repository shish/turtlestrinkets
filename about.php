					About
				</h2>

				<p>
My name is Rebecca (Becki) and I have always been obsessed with creating new things for people to
enjoy. I am often distracted by all manner of sparkly objects (ooooh! Shiny!!), yet I am a determined
individual who always strives for the best.
				</p>

				<p>
I became interested in jewellery design during my gap year. After studying History at university for
about eight weeks I discovered a tiny shop called The Bead Pot in a quiet corner of Canterbury. From
then on I was hooked. I left university for a year, and while working part time, I became fascinated
first by seed beads and bead looms, and soon by wire and pearls, which I continue to use today.
				</p>

				<p>
Turtleâ€™s Trinkets came about in my third year of university, close to Christmas time. A small shop
called We Made It, which was dedicated to selling the work of artisans in and around Canterbury,
opened up. At this point, I was making more jewellery than I could afford to keep, so some of my
friends suggested I apply to sell my bracelets and earrings in the shop. To my surprise they accepted
me! I will always be very grateful to the owners of that beautiful shop, as without this chance, I
would never have had the confidence to attempt this wonderful project.

So please feel free to have a browse around my new shiny website. All transactions will currently
take place through etsy.com. Thank you so much for your support!
